# Unity3D-Tower-Defense-Game-With-Pathfinding
### There is a copy of this game in the Releases section!
I used Breadth First Search Algorithm in this game. Basically breadth first search is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. The player's goal is to protect the player castle (blue) from the enemy castle (red). 

- You can exit the game with "Escape" key.
- With the 'c' key, you can turn the tile coordinates on or off.
- Each defense tower costs 75 gold.
- Every time player kills an enemy player gets 25 gold.
- If the enemy reaches the player castle (blue). The player loses 25 gold.
- Everytime the enemy is killed, enemy gains 2 more health.
### This is just a core concept and gameplay of the game. The future game design and gameplay will be added.
